# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe Game! This project allows you to play a classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe in two different modes: against another player or against the computer.

## How to Play

Upon starting the game, you'll be greeted with a welcome message and a display of the initial game board. Follow these steps to play:

1. **Choose the game mode:**
   - **Two Player:** Players take turns entering slot numbers to place their symbols (X or O).
   - **You vs Computer:** Play against the computer by selecting a difficulty level (Easy or Hard).
   
2. **Enter the slot number** corresponding to the position where you want to place your symbol (X or O).

3. The game alternates turns between players (or between the player and the computer).

4. The game detects and announces the winner or a draw.

## Minimax Algorithm

In Hard mode, the computer uses the Minimax algorithm, a recursive approach for decision-making that ensures the optimal move is selected at each step. This makes the AI unbeatable, providing a challenging experience for the player.

## Future Improvements

- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for enhanced user interaction.
- Expand the game to support larger board sizes.
- Implement additional AI strategies beyond Minimax for variety.
